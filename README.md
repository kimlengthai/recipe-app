# Recipe App with React

This project is a Recipe App built using React, where users can search for recipes, view recipe details, and add recipes to their favourites. It demonstrates fundamental concepts such as routing, state management using context, and integrating with external APIs.

## Getting Started

To get started with the app locally:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
4. Start the development server with `npm start`.

The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Features

- **Search Recipes**: Users can search for recipes based on keywords.
- **View Recipe Details**: Detailed information about each recipe is available, including ingredients and publisher details.
- **Favorites**: Users can add recipes to their favourites list, which persists across sessions.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to be responsive and works well on different devices.

## Technologies Used

- React
- React Router
- Context API for state management
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Fetch API for data fetching

## What I Learned

Throughout this project, I learned:
- How to set up routing to navigate between different pages.
- Creating and managing global state using React's Context API.
- Integrating external APIs to fetch and display data dynamically.
- Implementing responsive design principles using Tailwind CSS.

## Next Steps

Future enhancements and features that could be added to the app include:
- User authentication and profiles.
- More robust error handling and validation.
- Improving the user interface with animations and transitions.
- Enhancing search functionality with filters and sorting options.

Feel free to explore the codebase and contribute to making it even better!
